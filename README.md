## Overview

The Family manager (FM) application allows users to signup, and go to a specific page such as home page, to see the lists of all the tasks assigned to each family member. Moreover, the user may go to a different page such as projects page to view all the projects that were created by parents. The parents have to assign the tasks to children and children are able to see them with all the details such as description, comments related to that task.

## User Story

AS a parent, 

I want to be able to assign a specific task to my children, such as going to shop, what date he or she may go, what to buy and
so on. In addition, I want to be able to go back and update some informations if I change my mind. Also, I want to be able to delete a specific task assigned to my children; I want to be able to update, delete my projects that were created previously.

AS a User,

I want to be able to get specific data from the family manager app, I want to get specific tasks assigned to me, I want to get all the informations about the budget that may be spent daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. I want to see the tasks that were assigned to me, with all the details so I can fulfill my duty in a specific date as my parent ordained.


## Walk Through

In order to use this application:

1. You must signup with your information such as your name, date of birth, and email address. So once you signed up, you will be able to walk through all
the pages. If you are a child, it will direct you to the home page where you will see the lists of all the tasks created, with the due dates, assignees, descriptions, and comments.
The parents are responsible for creating a new task and assign it to a specific child. Once the new task is created, the children will be able to see it.
On the profile page, the user will be able to see the names of all family members and all the tasks assigned to specific users. Thus, whoever logs in will be able to see his or her profile with his name and all the tasks assigned him.
We also have the project page. This one displays all the projects that were created in order, with all the details related to them. The parents are responsible for creating a new project or a new task and assign it to a specific child.
In addition, we have the finance page. Basically, the children are able to view all the finance informations, but they are not allowed to update or delete them

## Future improvements

1.  When it comes to improving this application, we want to prevent children from trying to update or delete projects, tasks, or finance informations.
